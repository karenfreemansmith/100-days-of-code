**Job Hunting: **
* Applied for 2 jobs with cover letters/online applications
* Scheduled phone interview for job from one of yesterday's applicaitons
* Researched company for phone interiew
* Wrote a note to a high school friend that works at this company asking for any tips or advice on the interview.

**Thoughts: ** 
Job hunting could be more than a full-time job. It could be totally addictive like a video game, there is this never ending stream of job postings to sort through and research that could be done... I need to find a way to NOT get sucked into it so much. And a way to write cover letters faster... I feel bad that I have not written more code, but I got caught up looking at reviews and salary data on Glassdoor, and news feeds from the company until 9 or 10 pm. And it's not like I was "done" researching then...

A further exploration to write your own drag and drop feature was suggested and I would like to do that at some point...maybe on my ToDo List that is currently using jQueryUI for drag and drop?


### Day 3: February 27, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Practice (1-2)] - No link, it was all setup and overview. I should have watched these this weekend.

(Personal Projects)
* [Fixed the aligmnent on yesterday's tutorial](https://karenfreemansmith.github.io/JS30-Day26-StripeDropDown/)

**Job Hunting: **
* Interview. 
* Application => phone call (like in 10 minutes...). 
* Phone interview -> got stood up. 
* 2nd phone interview -> got stood up. Would it be wrong to say I'm not waiting by my phone for a recruiter to call me anymore? 
* 2 more applications with cover letters. 
* A letter of inquiry to a former employer. 
* Put today's activities, yesterdays, and all the inApply applications into a sreadsheet. I'm at 48 jobs (with a few missing...) applied to in the past 3 months. 

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm so tired right now...


### Day 2: February 26, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (3-5)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice)
* [JS30:Day26 - Stipe type follow along drop down](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day26-StripeDropDown)

**Job Hunting: **
Found a couple job listings on LinkedIn and reading some articles about making my profile better - planning to update the profile this evening and send off appplications to these 2 jobs (and a 3rd ont if I can find another, my goal is 3 per day).

**Thoughts: ** 
I really like this navigation trick - but the tutorial has a problem with where the drop down is displayed in relation to the menu. I need to troubleshoot that and then I may try to take that navigation and addit to my portfolio where I have too many links on my drop-downs to read them all - I could put a double column on the long ones maybe? The flex box with the wrap is starting to look pretty interesting too. It might be good for showing thumbnails on my portfolio page? I should probably concentrate on the projects that are likely to be shown on demo day though.


### Day 1: February 25, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (1-2)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice)
* [JS30:Day 25 - Event Propagation, bubbling & once](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day25-Events)

**Job Hunting: **
Posted updates on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter that I'm done with my internship and looking for work. Also recently updated and turned "on" profiles on Monster and Dice.com. Plus, I'm doing this code challenge to keep my skills sharp (and add a few new ones).

**Thoughts: ** 
I finished my internship yesterday and so feel like this is a good time to start on something new (and code-intensive). I'm looking for a real job and hope that I will find one before the end of this 100 days - which by the nature of new jobs may keep me from finishing - but in a good way. In the meantime I have been continuing through the JavaScript30 program and am on day 25 today. I'm planning to finish the series, take the flexbox and redux series that are offered for free, and pay my bills to see if I can afford the paid courses. I've got lots of school projects that could be improved on, and the curriculum for the classes I didn't take in PHP and C# seem like good candidates for things to do. We also have "Demo Day" coming up in a couple weeks and there are projects to polish up for that in the short term. 100 days seems like a long time. I think I should track my job hunting efforts as well...


### Day 0: February 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not sure it's relevant... I did day 19 of JavaScript30 for a few hours, but I'm starting tomorrow...or next weekend, or maybe in 3 weeks when my internship is over...

* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

**Job Hunting**
I've been kind of passively looking for work before and during my internship, the totals of those efforts have been...
* 31 Jobs applied for (most "inApply" on LinkedIn)
* 4 phone interviews
* 1 in-person interiew
* 2 rejection letters
* 1 job passed on

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing this tag a lot lately and a couple friends are doing it, I think. I'm not sure I want to make a commitment to code everyday. I mean, I do. But I'm not sure what counts. If I write code for 8 hours at work, do I still need to do another hour each night after work? (That's kind of the way I'm interpreting it...so it feels like logging work-related code might be cheating. But sometimes I work on it at home too... and then there really isn't any time!)
