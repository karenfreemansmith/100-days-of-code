**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)

(Personal Projects)
* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)

**Job Hunting: **
* 2nd Interview a US Bank

**Thoughts: ** 



### Day 20: March 16, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [World Language Library](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/wll4) - Rewriting in Angular, added components

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [Angular April Invitation](https://codepen.io/karenfreemansmith/project/full/ZWbbeD/) - An Online Invitation (30 Days, 30 Websites)

**Job Hunting: **
* [Watching videos](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/karen-freeman-smith) on some of the technologies they use so I can be better prepared for tomorrow's tech interview (J2EE, design patterns, interview tips, WebSphere)
* Laundry - no, really, you have to wear clean clothers to an interview, right?

**Thoughts: ** 
Not a lot to show for my day. I hope these videos sink in a little, and that I can find a decent outfit to wear to my interview tomorrow. I'm getting out of my comfort zone a little with today's project, not as much with the tech (I did use React, but nothing really new from what I've learned so far...) but wiht the copywriting. Our assignment was "an invitation". So, okay, I'm inviting people to learn Angular with me next month. And if I get any actual interest, then I will make some videos and setup a webpage or facebook group or whatever and actully try to run one of these challenges. Eeek...

Working on my language site is challenging because there is SO MUCH information, trying to figure out how to organize it into components and visualize how it's going to look on the website. It's days like to day I have more sympathy for clients that don't know what they want. I don't know exactly what I want right now either. (Which is the main reason the repository is private for now...)


### Day 19: March 15, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Movie Trivia](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-4-IntroTutorial) - Fixed the bug in the service from yesterday, added custom module, routing module, and 3rd party module to style with Angular Material 2.

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [Portfolio](http://codepen.io/karenfreemansmith/pen/PNOrjJ) - Refactoed portfolio from Epicodus to be one page for CodePen (Free Code Camp/30 Days, 30 Websites)

**Job Hunting: **
* Dug through my closet for a good outfit to wear to an interview at a bank, not happy wiht anything I found.
* Read another chapter from J2EE book

**Thoughts: ** 
I feel like I'm going so slow. I have all day (or close enough) to work on this, but I don't feel like I'm speeding along nearly as fast as we did during bootcamp. I do feel like I'm learning it better - so there may be something in going slower. Still, I feel a certain urgency as I could get quizzed on this stuff any day in an interview and I wish I could know everything. I don't think anyone can know everything - there is so much everything to learn. But I also feel like they will use anything you don't know as an excuse to not hire you.


### Day 18: March 14, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Movie Trivia](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-4-IntroTutorial) - Added 2 services, one works - the other doens't and I can't see any difference between the two.

**Job Hunting: **
* Got a callback for 2nd (technical) interview with US Bank on Friday
* Reading up on J2EE for interview

**Thoughts: ** 
Was feeling really good about the routing this morning, and then we started services... it was a huge amount of code from one working point to another and I'm still trying to find my missing bit or typo, or whatever it is that's keeping it from running. Hoping I can solve this one before bed. Thinking it may be time to pause and try to duplicate what I've learned on an unrelated project just to see if I really understand all the steps. And maybe review the video and take better notes as well. It just got overwhelming.


### Day 17: March 13, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Movie Trivia](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-4-IntroTutorial) - Added components and routing
* [Upgrading Angular 1 to Angular 2](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)

**Job Hunting: **
* My resume was submitted to Nike, and now more waiting. But optimistic that this company has the right pull as they have put me to work, and got me interviews previously.
* Diving into Angular, my week spot for this job - spent most the day reading or watching videos to try to better understand Angular's history and architecture.
* A job hunting seminar (free - so largely a commercial with a handful of good tips, one or two I had not seen before)

**Thoughts: ** 
I have not really written any code today. Mostly trying to setup Angular 4 on Cloud9, and/or on my desktop. Installation is slow and Node has to be upgraded before the new version of Angular will run. Feeling impatient...


### Day 18: March 12, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Upgrading Angular 1 to Angular 2](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)

(Personal Projects)
* [WLL](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-WorldLanguageLibrary) - Played around with Angular and upgrading the site. Found some limitations I was not expecting and had to undo a lot of what I did to get the site to display. Going back to watching videos to try to understand what I'm doing wrong there.

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthy](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Epic-Android-CapstoneProject) - Worked on maintaining state when phone rotates, gave up and set the project to portrait only for now. I think it's ready for the playstore at this point.

**Job Hunting: **
* Social/Networking stuff...last night was my first visit to Killer Android group, it was fun and the first meetup that felt really worth the effort of going. Alumni game night today with some friends from school - less beneficial, but a good break from it all.

**Thoughts: ** 
I think I made some good contacts last night. I got some practical help with my project and some advice from people who seem like they would know (job hunting), as well as feeling like I was right at home the first time I visited a group - very unusual. Two of them work at a place I'd like to work (and applied to back in December) and there is a feeling that after some time that contact could be helpful. I'm excited about a couple of my current potential jobs right now though so chasing a resume that is in the black hole right now doesn't seem like fun. 


### Day 15: March 11, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* Angular ToDo List (Treehouse)

(Personal Projects)
* WLL - Update site to use Angular, first step

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthy](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Epic-Android-CapstoneProject) - Fix small but annoying bugs, missing pictures, random change with change in screen orientation.

**Job Hunting: **
* Expanding resume to 2 pages to show more details on what I did when

**Thoughts: ** 
So much to do this weekend, but it feels good to have a deadline and more direction. Wishing I didn't have social commitements though, I want to spend all weekend coding (and less time than it will really take me to redo the resume).


### Day 14: March 10, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* Misc. small fixes on demo projects to deploy them for demo day

**Job Hunting: **
* Attended demo day...
* Got call back on one of the jobs I'm really excited about asking for some resume changes

**Thoughts: ** 
Was somewhat disappointed at lack of employer interest in our entire Java/Android track section of the floor. Excited about job possibility and dumping my weekend plans for rewriting my resume and reviewing all my Angular projects.


### Day 13: March 9, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (10-12)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice) - Flex Grow/Shrink

**Job Hunting: **
* Still waiting. Not applying today. Demo day is tomorrow. I was ready in January for the one they cancelled. I still can't think of anything I really want to try to "add" to the project until after the demo is done. (For fear of breaking everything else...)
* Attended meetup on soft skills interviewing, made a few new contacts (mostly other job seekers)

**Thoughts: ** 
Still feeling disorganized and distracted. I'm juggling a dozen things, at least 10 of which are probably not needed (Facebook for instance... to reading/studying various articles, but with no direction, no underlying goal)


### Day 12: March 8, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (6-9)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice) - Centering & Aligning

**Job Hunting: **
* Waiting to hear back on half a dozen things...
* A couple more recruiter calls, but no offers, no call backs. I think my resume is scaring them off, it didn't used to. Mabye I need to dig out my old resume and use it instead?

**Thoughts: ** 
Trying to get started with the coding early, so that any replies don't prevent me from doing anything at all. Still feeling distracted. I really meant to go add flexbox to some of my previous projects after I finished those tutorials, but I got lost somewhere along the picking one to start with. 


### Day 11: March 7, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [ES6 Tutorials (Arrow Functions Lessons 9 & 10)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/ES6Practice)

**Job Hunting: **
* Two email replies/interview questions (Nike/Pivotal)

**Thoughts: ** 
Waiting is the worst. The more I think I will hear back from someone, the harder it is to not stare at the inbox. I feel really cheap tonight because all I did was a couple quick tutorials. I spent all day... staring at my inbox??? You think that you will have all this time when you are out of work because you don't have to work, but sometimes I think I get more done when I have a job.


### Day 10: March 6, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (7-8-9)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay) - Passing data to components and routing
* [ES6 Tutorials (Arrow Functions Lessons 6-8)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/ES6Practice)

**Job Hunting: **
* One resume sent in response to recruiter inquiry - followed by phone interview and their client's timeline
* One resume sent in response to recruiter inquiry - followed by silence

**Thoughts: ** 
That first recruiter call did a lot to lift my mood, but I was doing better at sticking to the code when I was feeling depressed! After I'm all distracted trying to research the company I may be interviewing at later this week or next. Got through a nice chunk of the React turorial anyway. I'm starting to feel like I know enough to maybe add React to some of our Intro projects from Epicodus.


### Day 9: March 5, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (5 & 6)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay) - Fix styling and add first components

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Admin](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-Newsworthy) - Add first components and rudimentary styling

**Job Hunting: **
* One inApply
* Abandoned one online application because they wanted a more exciting cover letter than I think I can write for a job I probably won't even get a callback on. (You see the depression there? Maybe I'll snap out of it tomorrow...)

**Thoughts: ** 
Feeling depressed about not having a job, being too fat, feeling in the way all the time, and hurting from all the activity yesterday. Spent most of the day hiding in bed. Got up only to code. Not eating, hard to concentrate.


### Day 8: March 4, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (4 & 5)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay)

**Job Hunting: **
* None

**Thoughts: ** 
Busy day away from the computer attending my son's school event and then my boyfriend's flying lesson. Staying up late to take another setp or two on the reacct tutorials. The second one is giving me trouble, it doesn't seem to be working and I'm too tired to try to debug it tonight. It will be a place to start tomorrow.


### Day 7: March 3, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (3)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay)

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Backend](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-NewsWorthy) - setup project in React

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthy Android App](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Epic-Android-Capstone/) - update data for new president/cabinet

**Job Hunting: **
* Applied to 3 jobs, 1 inApply, 2 online apps
* Talk to 2 recruiters with jobs in Portland 1 via phone (FrontEnd Web Developer), 1 via email (Big Data)

**Thoughts: ** 
Felt like a good day, got the bulk of updates done on app, missed Secretary of State and may need some foreign leaders updated to. I want to build a front end that will make it easier to update people (and check for needed updates). Figure I can work on that at the same time as learning React. Got turned down for frontend job because I don't have a project to demonstrate that I can do React/Redux. Maybe this will be the one for the next time I have a recruiter calling looking for those skills.


### Day 6: March 2, 2017 (Thrusday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [ES6 Tutorials (Mod1: Lessons 1-5)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/ES6Practice)

(Personal Projects)
* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)
(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

**Job Hunting: **
* Phone interview with US Bank
* Updating LinkedIn per LinkedIn Training Videos
* Researching more on US Bank

**Thoughts: ** 
The interview went well, and that kept me distracted from my planned tasks all day as I consider the possible job offer. We talked about salary, even though that's a no-no. But it helps to know what to expect. It's kind of low for what I'd like, but not completely out of the ballpark, so it's really more about the job. I think I might not stay for more than a year or two because of the salary - but that seems long enough to see what kind of upward mobility there is in the company. AND it's hard to get the first job, right? So it seems like I should just take the first one that comes along... 6 months ago at the beginning of bootcamp it felt different, like I'd hold out for... something. Now I'm trying to remember what. But for now I'll assume the other job leads will also pan out and even comparing with those, I think this is the better job because it's Java, which is one step closer to Android no matter what the pay and benefits. Glad it was an easy few lessons tonight - my mind is so much more on the job search right now.


### Day 5: March 1, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [JS30-Day28: Video Playback Rate](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day28-VideoTiming)
* [JS30-Day29: Countdown Timer](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day29-CountDownTimer)
* [JS30-Day30: Whack-A-Mole](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day30-WhackAMole/tree/gh-pages)

(Personal Projects)
* [Whack-a-Pol(ititian)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Whack-a-Pol/tree/gh-pages) - Because the Whack-a-mole was so much fun!

**Job Hunting: **
* Taking a day off to focus more on the coding (besides, I have my goal of 10 applications for the week and an interiew tomorrow)

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm excited about the whack-a-mole game so am trying to finish up the 30 days (as opposed to skipping it) and want to make some modifications and create my own "Whack-a-Pol(ititian)" version of the game that I can share with my friends. I also need to update some politician photos on my "NewsWorthy" app, so the projects go well together. One of the two extra projects finished, Tomorrow I will get to the NewsWorthy updates while I wait for that interview.


### Day 4: February 28, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Click and Drag to Scroll](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day27-HorizontalScroller)

**Job Hunting: **
* Applied for 2 jobs with cover letters/online applications
* Scheduled phone interview for job from one of yesterday's applicaitons
* Researched company for phone interiew
* Wrote a note to a high school friend that works at this company asking for any tips or advice on the interview.

**Thoughts: ** 
Job hunting could be more than a full-time job. It could be totally addictive like a video game, there is this never ending stream of job postings to sort through and research that could be done... I need to find a way to NOT get sucked into it so much. And a way to write cover letters faster... I feel bad that I have not written more code, but I got caught up looking at reviews and salary data on Glassdoor, and news feeds from the company until 9 or 10 pm. And it's not like I was "done" researching then...

A further exploration to write your own drag and drop feature was suggested and I would like to do that at some point...maybe on my ToDo List that is currently using jQueryUI for drag and drop?


### Day 3: February 27, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Practice (1-2)] - No link, it was all setup and overview. I should have watched these this weekend.

(Personal Projects)
* [Fixed the aligmnent on yesterday's tutorial](https://karenfreemansmith.github.io/JS30-Day26-StripeDropDown/)

**Job Hunting: **
* Interview. 
* Application => phone call (like in 10 minutes...). 
* Phone interview -> got stood up. 
* 2nd phone interview -> got stood up. Would it be wrong to say I'm not waiting by my phone for a recruiter to call me anymore? 
* 2 more applications with cover letters. 
* A letter of inquiry to a former employer. 
* Put today's activities, yesterdays, and all the inApply applications into a sreadsheet. I'm at 48 jobs (with a few missing...) applied to in the past 3 months. 

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm so tired right now...


### Day 2: February 26, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (3-5)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice)
* [JS30:Day26 - Stipe type follow along drop down](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day26-StripeDropDown)

**Job Hunting: **
Found a couple job listings on LinkedIn and reading some articles about making my profile better - planning to update the profile this evening and send off appplications to these 2 jobs (and a 3rd ont if I can find another, my goal is 3 per day).

**Thoughts: ** 
I really like this navigation trick - but the tutorial has a problem with where the drop down is displayed in relation to the menu. I need to troubleshoot that and then I may try to take that navigation and addit to my portfolio where I have too many links on my drop-downs to read them all - I could put a double column on the long ones maybe? The flex box with the wrap is starting to look pretty interesting too. It might be good for showing thumbnails on my portfolio page? I should probably concentrate on the projects that are likely to be shown on demo day though.


### Day 1: February 25, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (1-2)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice)
* [JS30:Day 25 - Event Propagation, bubbling & once](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day25-Events)

**Job Hunting: **
Posted updates on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter that I'm done with my internship and looking for work. Also recently updated and turned "on" profiles on Monster and Dice.com. Plus, I'm doing this code challenge to keep my skills sharp (and add a few new ones).

**Thoughts: ** 
I finished my internship yesterday and so feel like this is a good time to start on something new (and code-intensive). I'm looking for a real job and hope that I will find one before the end of this 100 days - which by the nature of new jobs may keep me from finishing - but in a good way. In the meantime I have been continuing through the JavaScript30 program and am on day 25 today. I'm planning to finish the series, take the flexbox and redux series that are offered for free, and pay my bills to see if I can afford the paid courses. I've got lots of school projects that could be improved on, and the curriculum for the classes I didn't take in PHP and C# seem like good candidates for things to do. We also have "Demo Day" coming up in a couple weeks and there are projects to polish up for that in the short term. 100 days seems like a long time. I think I should track my job hunting efforts as well...


### Day 0: February 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not sure it's relevant... I did day 19 of JavaScript30 for a few hours, but I'm starting tomorrow...or next weekend, or maybe in 3 weeks when my internship is over...

* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

**Job Hunting**
I've been kind of passively looking for work before and during my internship, the totals of those efforts have been...
* 31 Jobs applied for (most "inApply" on LinkedIn)
* 4 phone interviews
* 1 in-person interiew
* 2 rejection letters
* 1 job passed on

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing this tag a lot lately and a couple friends are doing it, I think. I'm not sure I want to make a commitment to code everyday. I mean, I do. But I'm not sure what counts. If I write code for 8 hours at work, do I still need to do another hour each night after work? (That's kind of the way I'm interpreting it...so it feels like logging work-related code might be cheating. But sometimes I work on it at home too... and then there really isn't any time!)
