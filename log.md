# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not sure it's relevant... I did day 19 of JavaScript30 for a few hours, but I'm starting tomorrow...or next weekend, or maybe in 3 weeks when my internship is over...

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing this tag a lot lately and a couple friends are doing it, I think. I'm not sure I want to make a commitment to code everyday. I mean, I do. But I'm not sure what counts. If I write code for 8 hours at work, do I still need to do another hour each night after work? (That's kind of the way I'm interpreting it...so it feels like logging work-related code might be cheating. But sometimes I work on it at home too... and then there really isn't any time!)
