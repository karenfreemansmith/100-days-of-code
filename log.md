* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

**Job Hunting: **
* Researched company for Monday's interview

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm feeling good about my project again. Felt lost this morning with "what to do next". I have no idea really what I'm going to do on this video from this point forward, and they are taking a lot longer than I think they should to make. Today was a little better though, once I started making it. I still have a few more things to create as "homework" though. 


### Day 36: April 1, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [Angular April Website](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilWebsite) - Update day 2, add direction for others
* [Angular April Personal Site](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject1) - add components & routing
* [Angular April Business Site](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject2) - add components & routing
* [Angular April Online Store](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject3) - add components & routing
* [Angular April Community Site](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject4) - add components & routing

**Job Hunting: **
* Attended meetup, passed out a business card, made a couple new friends

**Thoughts: ** 
It's hard to be the one hold out in a room full of people learning Go, or React. But I did get to help troubleshoot (maybe) a stuborn Android Studio problem. No work on my project though because the Internet was not available from my corner of the building. Meanwhile, back at home I have day 2 finished and uploaed and linked. I never did hear back on that proposal for the freelance job in Seattle. It's the weekend now, but I suspect my estimate was too high. But it's hard to estimate time/costs for a project without more details. The unknown always turns into "worst case senario" for me. It's like that hesitation in the interview for that job. I am too honest and can't just tell people what they want to hear. I don't know if I can survive in the world of IT with a handicap like that.


### Day 35: March 31, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [Angular April Website](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilWebsite) - Update day 1
* [Angular April Online Store](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject3) - setup project with material
* [Angular April Community Site](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject4) - setup project with material

**Job Hunting: **
* Attended meetup
* Responded to new job lead - Sngular
* Scheduled phone interivew with ThinkShout

**Thoughts: ** 
A little virtual vengance and a good night's sleep and I'm back to a better state emotionally, and moving forward with my project. I have an interview for the job I applied to - yesterday... I like the turn around time. And it loks like my dream company. So thanks to the so-so guys that didn't offer me a job for which I would have quit looking and applying! Meanwhile, I have my first real video up and ready to go. It's almost an hour long and starts 4 new projects for Angular. I will be focusing my attentions on this one thing for the most part - all next month. No good reason, only that Angular and April sound good together. Everything else is going on the back burner for now. I expect more focus to really help me progress faster...and in May I can pick up one of those things I'm shoving to the background for now. It's hard though, there are so many shiny objects to chase after in this world of programming languages and frameworks.


### Day 34: March 30, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [Angular April Website](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilWebsite) - expand website
* [Angular April Personal Site](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject1) - setup project
* [Angular April Business Site](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilProject2) - setup project with bootstrap

**Job Hunting: **
* Applied to ThinkShout
* Found out someone else just accepted the job I had the highest hopes for...depressing

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm depressed and frustrated with the job hunt. I'm so glad I have this project to fall back on - to be excited about. At the same time, I had to pause this evening and just drink and watch Cersei blow up the Sept of Balor one more time. This time feeling it from Cersei's viewpoint. My best friend just accepted the job I was thinking I would be offered. I'm happy for her, but frustrated beause she told me how much she doesn't really want it and plans to stay only as long as it takes to find the next job. I would have stayed a lot longer than that. (She's very talented - wondering if she'll even make it through whatever orientation they have before the next offer comes along?) The frustration is more in knowing that she felt that way, but somehow she went into the interview and charmed them and told them what they wanted to hear regardless of her true intentions. Why can't I do that? I mean, I hesitated because I was not sure I'd stay the decades they seemed to be looking for. And they saw that hesitation and read into it... well, something they must not have seen in my "quit tomorrow if something better comes along" friend. Not being able to compete in interviews that way kills me. Always has...


### Day 33: March 29, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [Angular April Website](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilWebsite) - Setup informational website for project

**Job Hunting: **
* Not sure if my current project to make videos might count as a job hunting activity or not...

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm excited about this new projet and find that making up the "curriculum" for these videos took up my whole day and made it pass pretty quickly. Scary to contemplate a video series that includes things I have not figure out how to do yet - but in a good/exciting kind of scary.


### Day 32: March 28, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

(Personal Projects)
* [Angular April](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/AngularAprilWebsite) - Made a landing page for the Angular challenge I'm going to put out next month... also an intro video and put it up on YouTube, not coding, but kind of related. 

**Job Hunting: **
* Follow up with freelance job
* Field recruiter contact (probably for Nike)

**Thoughts: ** 
Whoo-hoo! I made a video. People have watched it... Guess that means I'm committed to making 30 more for this experiment. Hoping I can keep my personal learning curve ahead of the scheduled videos.


### Day 31: March 27, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Backend](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-NewsWorthy) - more services, finally got the JSON working and messed up somthing when I tried to merge the branch back into master.

**Job Hunting: **
* Follow up on freelance job, review requirements and start estimate

**Thoughts: ** 
I feel reluctant to pick up and start over, but I'm missing all the files that were overlooked in .gitignore file and automatically installed with the ng new cli command. Sometimes I really hate automation. I can't just run the command again to fix it, and I want to know enough to fix it by hand when these things go wrong, but I don't. I'm not even sure you can with these tools...


### Day 30: March 26, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Backend](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-NewsWorthy) - more services, finally got the JSON working and messed up somthing when I tried to merge the branch back into master.

**Job Hunting: **
* None, weekend

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm glad to be focused on one project, and I'm getting a lot done, or was until that merge problem and now I wonder if I need to start over from scratch (again)... but I have code I can cut and paste if that is the case. I feel like I'm forgetting stuff though - all those other projects I'm not working on. I have too many projects.


### Day 29: March 25, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Backend](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-NewsWorthy) - Working on adding services at meetup and continuing at home

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

**Job Hunting: **
* Saturday Mentorship Meetup, talked to people, no jobs present - lots of job seekers

**Thoughts: ** 
The meetup was good. I knew some people, I met some people. I didn't get a lot done on my project, but I was all energized and focused when I got home.


### Day 28: March 24, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [Books & Articles](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/) - building a list of project ideas. Thinking of ways to use it as a funnel for other projects like "Angular April" which is about to be renamed "Angular August" as I keep working on other things instead.

**Job Hunting: **
* Pone interview with Scott from Artitudes, a Seattle design firm with a need for a backend billing application
* Follow up on a couple other job leads, sent resume to Matt for eBay, talked to recruiter from Experis about a testing position and passed it on to a more qualified classmate when I was not enough of what they were looking for.

**Thoughts: ** 
I have too many things on my to-do list. I think I'd accomplish more if I had a shorter list, or at least that I would get started sooner if I limited myself to just one programming task a day instead of my current list which is like 48 hours of programming stuff i want to do. Too much stuff just makes it hard to get started.



### Day 27: March 23, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthyFlashcards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karenfreemansmith.flashcards) - some more work on in-app billing, following code on Trivial Drive sample
* [GitHubChallenge](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Epic-Android-GithubChallenge) - Added strict mode to see where delays in app might be coming from

**Job Hunting: **
* The big meetup at eBay... fun, but not much good for job hunting. I like the group and expect to be a regular there, but not that it's the networking opportunity meetups are supposed to be.
* Came home and applied for about 5 more jobs in my disappointment (some with the more challenging online ap instead of inApply)

**Thoughts: ** 
It was nice to catch up with some of my classmates at the meetup. Don't know how many of them socialized outside our circle, hope some of them come back to the group - but I see a lot of people thinking other mobile platforms are more interesting, so maybe not? I don't think networking at meetups is my thing - not for jobs. But I did enjoy the meetup and met some new people and socialized with both the Saturday group and also the Epicodus group while I was there. Not making as much progress on the play store apps as I would like. Or even on the wath videos and learn more Java to bring up my skill rating on PluralSight. I feel depressed. Johnathan called with some problems and felt really stressed about not having enough money to fix them for him. I hate being unemployed. It's all getting in the way of doing stuff. 


### Day 26: March 22, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthyFlashcards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karenfreemansmith.flashcards) - Uploaded a stable version and shared link with friends, still working on implementing the in-app billing.

**Job Hunting: **
* Just waiting by the phone and coding/studying (preparing for the non-existant interviews)

**Thoughts: ** 
Watching a lot of videos on Java, after several hours we are finally gettting to the part where I don't feel like it's complete review...which is maybe 25% through the beginner section. Now with class inheritance and various Java libraries there is a lot more new information, or reviewing stuff that is more than just forgetting if it's a "(" or a "[" in this language. Some people from bootcamp are starting to report new jobs - which is encouraging. Most are not quite programming jobs though, which is not so much. I don't mind not being first. I'd really like to see some of my classmates get their foot in the door somewhere. It would be a push as I'm getting tired of spamming my resume into the black hole. There is a new crop of interns this week. My friend who stayed on is jealous they are getting better "training/orientation" than we did. I'm more worried about MORE jr.devs on the job market before our group all find something. It's a worry day... and slow coding, although I'm making steps toward this in-app thing... baby steps.


### Day 25: March 21, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthyFlashcards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karenfreemansmith.flashcards) - Set up the library for in-app billing

**Job Hunting: **
* Applied for a direct position as "Sr. Java Developer" with Intel... it took 3 online applications to get to their real application

**Thoughts: ** 
I did find a small typo on my resume while filling out hte Intel thing...it was in my phone number. If anyone has been getting randokm calls for interviews, send them back my way, okay? Not sure how many bad phone number resumes I actually sent out, probably only 2 or 3. Kinda glad it's been a slow job hunting week. The in-app billing is more complicated than I expected and I feel lost half the time I'm tring to read the documentation or watch the video. I'm hoping following step by step will be easier than it looks. I also retook some of the skills assessments on PluralSight and got much better scores on the ones that came back surprisingly low, probably makes a difference how awake you are when taking them. Much happier with the profile page now anyway.


### Day 24: March 20, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [GitHubChallenge](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/) - I signed the APK and uploaded it to the play store, waiting for approval or processing or something. It wasn't as instant as I thought it would be. Only 2 images in there and I think they are both public domain, so I'm hoping... but, no it was rejected for too my ANR and crashes)
* [NewsWorthyFlashcards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karenfreemansmith.flashcards) - Got this one accepted thought. Except it's not really finished, I want to add in-app billing to it

**Job Hunting: **
* Contacted about 2 jobs with Aditi Consulting...they submitted my resume for one or both (?-Not actually sure if they did the front end position, but they did submit me for the Android job... whoot! I'm not qualified really don't expect to hear back on it.)

**Thoughts: ** 
I didn't feel like doing anything today, and sat down and tried anyway. I'm pretty happy with all the (non-coding) that I managed to do to get this app online. It's still pending, but hopefully I'll have a link by tomorrow. And then the fixing will begin... I'm sure there are things I will need to work on with the user interface already. It seems like the app is bigger than my phone all of the sudden... but I put it out there anyway - because it's never going to be perfect.


### Day 23: March 19, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [Angular April](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/books-articles) - Outlined 30 day course assignments to learn Angular

**Job Hunting: **
* Nothing - well, maybe this tutorial project will turn into a thing that I can get paid for or that convinces someone I can do their job, who knows?

**Thoughts: ** 
I spent a lot of time on this. I didn't mean to, but once I got started I just kept going. I have a pretty good script started almost through the first week. I got all the pieces in small enough parts to follow along (I think) and still got everything done with a few review days for catch up or questions. I actually feel like this could be a real thing.


### Day 22: March 18, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [World Language Library](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/wll4) - Added routing

**Job Hunting: **
* Set up developer & merchant account on Google play store (because having an app on the playstore is supposed to impress potential employers - and if it doesn't I might want to earn soem money with in-app purchases someday)

**Thoughts: ** 
Setup is always the time suck... even when it's setting up a developer account. Because then you want a business name and so you have to invent one, and register yet another domain name to make it feel "real" - which means setting up the web hosting and email... and you suddenly realize it's time for bed and you have not written any actual CODE. But on the good side, I did the routing mostly from memory this time. Repetition is truly a key for my learning style.


### Day 21: March 17, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Backend](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-Newsworthy) - Components and Routing, some data

**Job Hunting: **
* 2nd Interview a US Bank

**Thoughts: ** 
The interview went good, I think. They are looking for people who will like the job and stay a long time (as in decades). I think I would like the job and stay a few years. It seemed like a nice team and it might be hard to leave/easy to stay, but at some point I think I would want to do more coding, or more interesting work. Although they did say they expect a new person to take 3-5 years to learn the job. I can't even imagine anything complex enough to take that long to learn - so maybe boredom would not be as big a factor as I think. I do think they sensed I might not be happy for a real long tie as well though, so I can see the job slipping away to someone who is better at laying it on thick about how much they love the company and want to spend the rest of their life there.

All of which has me thinking more about the job hunt and asking myself if I should even apply to positions that aren't exactly what I want to be doing for the next 5-10 years or more. I think most places expect more turnover than that (or else offer more incentives to stay). I think I will look harder for actual Android positions though, and maybe Java developer, but less web developer as that is okay for a year or two, but again, not my long term goal.


### Day 20: March 16, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

(Personal Projects)
* [World Language Library](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/wll4) - Rewriting in Angular, added components

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [Angular April Invitation](https://codepen.io/karenfreemansmith/project/full/ZWbbeD/) - An Online Invitation (30 Days, 30 Websites)

**Job Hunting: **
* [Watching videos](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/karen-freeman-smith) on some of the technologies they use so I can be better prepared for tomorrow's tech interview (J2EE, design patterns, interview tips, WebSphere)
* Laundry - no, really, you have to wear clean clothers to an interview, right?

**Thoughts: ** 
Not a lot to show for my day. I hope these videos sink in a little, and that I can find a decent outfit to wear to my interview tomorrow. I'm getting out of my comfort zone a little with today's project, not as much with the tech (I did use React, but nothing really new from what I've learned so far...) but wiht the copywriting. Our assignment was "an invitation". So, okay, I'm inviting people to learn Angular with me next month. And if I get any actual interest, then I will make some videos and setup a webpage or facebook group or whatever and actully try to run one of these challenges. Eeek...

Working on my language site is challenging because there is SO MUCH information, trying to figure out how to organize it into components and visualize how it's going to look on the website. It's days like to day I have more sympathy for clients that don't know what they want. I don't know exactly what I want right now either. (Which is the main reason the repository is private for now...)


### Day 19: March 15, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Movie Trivia](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-4-IntroTutorial) - Fixed the bug in the service from yesterday, added custom module, routing module, and 3rd party module to style with Angular Material 2.

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [Portfolio](http://codepen.io/karenfreemansmith/pen/PNOrjJ) - Refactoed portfolio from Epicodus to be one page for CodePen (Free Code Camp/30 Days, 30 Websites)

**Job Hunting: **
* Dug through my closet for a good outfit to wear to an interview at a bank, not happy wiht anything I found.
* Read another chapter from J2EE book

**Thoughts: ** 
I feel like I'm going so slow. I have all day (or close enough) to work on this, but I don't feel like I'm speeding along nearly as fast as we did during bootcamp. I do feel like I'm learning it better - so there may be something in going slower. Still, I feel a certain urgency as I could get quizzed on this stuff any day in an interview and I wish I could know everything. I don't think anyone can know everything - there is so much everything to learn. But I also feel like they will use anything you don't know as an excuse to not hire you.


### Day 18: March 14, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Movie Trivia](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-4-IntroTutorial) - Added 2 services, one works - the other doens't and I can't see any difference between the two.

**Job Hunting: **
* Got a callback for 2nd (technical) interview with US Bank on Friday
* Reading up on J2EE for interview

**Thoughts: ** 
Was feeling really good about the routing this morning, and then we started services... it was a huge amount of code from one working point to another and I'm still trying to find my missing bit or typo, or whatever it is that's keeping it from running. Hoping I can solve this one before bed. Thinking it may be time to pause and try to duplicate what I've learned on an unrelated project just to see if I really understand all the steps. And maybe review the video and take better notes as well. It just got overwhelming.


### Day 17: March 13, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Movie Trivia](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-4-IntroTutorial) - Added components and routing
* [Upgrading Angular 1 to Angular 2](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)

**Job Hunting: **
* My resume was submitted to Nike, and now more waiting. But optimistic that this company has the right pull as they have put me to work, and got me interviews previously.
* Diving into Angular, my week spot for this job - spent most the day reading or watching videos to try to better understand Angular's history and architecture.
* A job hunting seminar (free - so largely a commercial with a handful of good tips, one or two I had not seen before)

**Thoughts: ** 
I have not really written any code today. Mostly trying to setup Angular 4 on Cloud9, and/or on my desktop. Installation is slow and Node has to be upgraded before the new version of Angular will run. Feeling impatient...


### Day 18: March 12, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Angular 4 Video on Safari Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)
* [Upgrading Angular 1 to Angular 2](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)

(Personal Projects)
* [WLL](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Angular-WorldLanguageLibrary) - Played around with Angular and upgrading the site. Found some limitations I was not expecting and had to undo a lot of what I did to get the site to display. Going back to watching videos to try to understand what I'm doing wrong there.

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthy](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Epic-Android-CapstoneProject) - Worked on maintaining state when phone rotates, gave up and set the project to portrait only for now. I think it's ready for the playstore at this point.

**Job Hunting: **
* Social/Networking stuff...last night was my first visit to Killer Android group, it was fun and the first meetup that felt really worth the effort of going. Alumni game night today with some friends from school - less beneficial, but a good break from it all.

**Thoughts: ** 
I think I made some good contacts last night. I got some practical help with my project and some advice from people who seem like they would know (job hunting), as well as feeling like I was right at home the first time I visited a group - very unusual. Two of them work at a place I'd like to work (and applied to back in December) and there is a feeling that after some time that contact could be helpful. I'm excited about a couple of my current potential jobs right now though so chasing a resume that is in the black hole right now doesn't seem like fun. 


### Day 15: March 11, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* Angular ToDo List (Treehouse)

(Personal Projects)
* WLL - Update site to use Angular, first step

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthy](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Epic-Android-CapstoneProject) - Fix small but annoying bugs, missing pictures, random change with change in screen orientation.

**Job Hunting: **
* Expanding resume to 2 pages to show more details on what I did when

**Thoughts: ** 
So much to do this weekend, but it feels good to have a deadline and more direction. Wishing I didn't have social commitements though, I want to spend all weekend coding (and less time than it will really take me to redo the resume).


### Day 14: March 10, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* Misc. small fixes on demo projects to deploy them for demo day

**Job Hunting: **
* Attended demo day...
* Got call back on one of the jobs I'm really excited about asking for some resume changes

**Thoughts: ** 
Was somewhat disappointed at lack of employer interest in our entire Java/Android track section of the floor. Excited about job possibility and dumping my weekend plans for rewriting my resume and reviewing all my Angular projects.


### Day 13: March 9, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (10-12)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice) - Flex Grow/Shrink

**Job Hunting: **
* Still waiting. Not applying today. Demo day is tomorrow. I was ready in January for the one they cancelled. I still can't think of anything I really want to try to "add" to the project until after the demo is done. (For fear of breaking everything else...)
* Attended meetup on soft skills interviewing, made a few new contacts (mostly other job seekers)

**Thoughts: ** 
Still feeling disorganized and distracted. I'm juggling a dozen things, at least 10 of which are probably not needed (Facebook for instance... to reading/studying various articles, but with no direction, no underlying goal)


### Day 12: March 8, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (6-9)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice) - Centering & Aligning

**Job Hunting: **
* Waiting to hear back on half a dozen things...
* A couple more recruiter calls, but no offers, no call backs. I think my resume is scaring them off, it didn't used to. Mabye I need to dig out my old resume and use it instead?

**Thoughts: ** 
Trying to get started with the coding early, so that any replies don't prevent me from doing anything at all. Still feeling distracted. I really meant to go add flexbox to some of my previous projects after I finished those tutorials, but I got lost somewhere along the picking one to start with. 


### Day 11: March 7, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [ES6 Tutorials (Arrow Functions Lessons 9 & 10)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/ES6Practice)

**Job Hunting: **
* Two email replies/interview questions (Nike/Pivotal)

**Thoughts: ** 
Waiting is the worst. The more I think I will hear back from someone, the harder it is to not stare at the inbox. I feel really cheap tonight because all I did was a couple quick tutorials. I spent all day... staring at my inbox??? You think that you will have all this time when you are out of work because you don't have to work, but sometimes I think I get more done when I have a job.


### Day 10: March 6, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (7-8-9)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay) - Passing data to components and routing
* [ES6 Tutorials (Arrow Functions Lessons 6-8)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/ES6Practice)

**Job Hunting: **
* One resume sent in response to recruiter inquiry - followed by phone interview and their client's timeline
* One resume sent in response to recruiter inquiry - followed by silence

**Thoughts: ** 
That first recruiter call did a lot to lift my mood, but I was doing better at sticking to the code when I was feeling depressed! After I'm all distracted trying to research the company I may be interviewing at later this week or next. Got through a nice chunk of the React turorial anyway. I'm starting to feel like I know enough to maybe add React to some of our Intro projects from Epicodus.


### Day 9: March 5, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (5 & 6)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay) - Fix styling and add first components

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Admin](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-Newsworthy) - Add first components and rudimentary styling

**Job Hunting: **
* One inApply
* Abandoned one online application because they wanted a more exciting cover letter than I think I can write for a job I probably won't even get a callback on. (You see the depression there? Maybe I'll snap out of it tomorrow...)

**Thoughts: ** 
Feeling depressed about not having a job, being too fat, feeling in the way all the time, and hurting from all the activity yesterday. Spent most of the day hiding in bed. Got up only to code. Not eating, hard to concentrate.


### Day 8: March 4, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (4 & 5)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay)

**Job Hunting: **
* None

**Thoughts: ** 
Busy day away from the computer attending my son's school event and then my boyfriend's flying lesson. Staying up late to take another setp or two on the reacct tutorials. The second one is giving me trouble, it doesn't seem to be working and I'm too tired to try to debug it tonight. It will be a place to start tomorrow.


### Day 7: March 3, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Tutorials (3)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-CatchOfDay)

(Personal Projects)
* [NewsWorthy Backend](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/React-NewsWorthy) - setup project in React

(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [NewsWorthy Android App](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Epic-Android-Capstone/) - update data for new president/cabinet

**Job Hunting: **
* Applied to 3 jobs, 1 inApply, 2 online apps
* Talk to 2 recruiters with jobs in Portland 1 via phone (FrontEnd Web Developer), 1 via email (Big Data)

**Thoughts: ** 
Felt like a good day, got the bulk of updates done on app, missed Secretary of State and may need some foreign leaders updated to. I want to build a front end that will make it easier to update people (and check for needed updates). Figure I can work on that at the same time as learning React. Got turned down for frontend job because I don't have a project to demonstrate that I can do React/Redux. Maybe this will be the one for the next time I have a recruiter calling looking for those skills.


### Day 6: March 2, 2017 (Thrusday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [ES6 Tutorials (Mod1: Lessons 1-5)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/ES6Practice)

(Personal Projects)
* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)
(Other...FreeCodeCamp/Epicodus/OpenSource)
* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

**Job Hunting: **
* Phone interview with US Bank
* Updating LinkedIn per LinkedIn Training Videos
* Researching more on US Bank

**Thoughts: ** 
The interview went well, and that kept me distracted from my planned tasks all day as I consider the possible job offer. We talked about salary, even though that's a no-no. But it helps to know what to expect. It's kind of low for what I'd like, but not completely out of the ballpark, so it's really more about the job. I think I might not stay for more than a year or two because of the salary - but that seems long enough to see what kind of upward mobility there is in the company. AND it's hard to get the first job, right? So it seems like I should just take the first one that comes along... 6 months ago at the beginning of bootcamp it felt different, like I'd hold out for... something. Now I'm trying to remember what. But for now I'll assume the other job leads will also pan out and even comparing with those, I think this is the better job because it's Java, which is one step closer to Android no matter what the pay and benefits. Glad it was an easy few lessons tonight - my mind is so much more on the job search right now.


### Day 5: March 1, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [JS30-Day28: Video Playback Rate](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day28-VideoTiming)
* [JS30-Day29: Countdown Timer](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day29-CountDownTimer)
* [JS30-Day30: Whack-A-Mole](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day30-WhackAMole/tree/gh-pages)

(Personal Projects)
* [Whack-a-Pol(ititian)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/Whack-a-Pol/tree/gh-pages) - Because the Whack-a-mole was so much fun!

**Job Hunting: **
* Taking a day off to focus more on the coding (besides, I have my goal of 10 applications for the week and an interiew tomorrow)

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm excited about the whack-a-mole game so am trying to finish up the 30 days (as opposed to skipping it) and want to make some modifications and create my own "Whack-a-Pol(ititian)" version of the game that I can share with my friends. I also need to update some politician photos on my "NewsWorthy" app, so the projects go well together. One of the two extra projects finished, Tomorrow I will get to the NewsWorthy updates while I wait for that interview.


### Day 4: February 28, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Click and Drag to Scroll](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day27-HorizontalScroller)

**Job Hunting: **
* Applied for 2 jobs with cover letters/online applications
* Scheduled phone interview for job from one of yesterday's applicaitons
* Researched company for phone interiew
* Wrote a note to a high school friend that works at this company asking for any tips or advice on the interview.

**Thoughts: ** 
Job hunting could be more than a full-time job. It could be totally addictive like a video game, there is this never ending stream of job postings to sort through and research that could be done... I need to find a way to NOT get sucked into it so much. And a way to write cover letters faster... I feel bad that I have not written more code, but I got caught up looking at reviews and salary data on Glassdoor, and news feeds from the company until 9 or 10 pm. And it's not like I was "done" researching then...

A further exploration to write your own drag and drop feature was suggested and I would like to do that at some point...maybe on my ToDo List that is currently using jQueryUI for drag and drop?


### Day 3: February 27, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [React Practice (1-2)] - No link, it was all setup and overview. I should have watched these this weekend.

(Personal Projects)
* [Fixed the aligmnent on yesterday's tutorial](https://karenfreemansmith.github.io/JS30-Day26-StripeDropDown/)

**Job Hunting: **
* Interview. 
* Application => phone call (like in 10 minutes...). 
* Phone interview -> got stood up. 
* 2nd phone interview -> got stood up. Would it be wrong to say I'm not waiting by my phone for a recruiter to call me anymore? 
* 2 more applications with cover letters. 
* A letter of inquiry to a former employer. 
* Put today's activities, yesterdays, and all the inApply applications into a sreadsheet. I'm at 48 jobs (with a few missing...) applied to in the past 3 months. 

**Thoughts: ** 
I'm so tired right now...


### Day 2: February 26, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (3-5)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice)
* [JS30:Day26 - Stipe type follow along drop down](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day26-StripeDropDown)

**Job Hunting: **
Found a couple job listings on LinkedIn and reading some articles about making my profile better - planning to update the profile this evening and send off appplications to these 2 jobs (and a 3rd ont if I can find another, my goal is 3 per day).

**Thoughts: ** 
I really like this navigation trick - but the tutorial has a problem with where the drop down is displayed in relation to the menu. I need to troubleshoot that and then I may try to take that navigation and addit to my portfolio where I have too many links on my drop-downs to read them all - I could put a double column on the long ones maybe? The flex box with the wrap is starting to look pretty interesting too. It might be good for showing thumbnails on my portfolio page? I should probably concentrate on the projects that are likely to be shown on demo day though.


### Day 1: February 25, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 
(Tutorials)
* [Flexbox Practice (1-2)](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/flexbox-practice)
* [JS30:Day 25 - Event Propagation, bubbling & once](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/JS30-Day25-Events)

**Job Hunting: **
Posted updates on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter that I'm done with my internship and looking for work. Also recently updated and turned "on" profiles on Monster and Dice.com. Plus, I'm doing this code challenge to keep my skills sharp (and add a few new ones).

**Thoughts: ** 
I finished my internship yesterday and so feel like this is a good time to start on something new (and code-intensive). I'm looking for a real job and hope that I will find one before the end of this 100 days - which by the nature of new jobs may keep me from finishing - but in a good way. In the meantime I have been continuing through the JavaScript30 program and am on day 25 today. I'm planning to finish the series, take the flexbox and redux series that are offered for free, and pay my bills to see if I can afford the paid courses. I've got lots of school projects that could be improved on, and the curriculum for the classes I didn't take in PHP and C# seem like good candidates for things to do. We also have "Demo Day" coming up in a couple weeks and there are projects to polish up for that in the short term. 100 days seems like a long time. I think I should track my job hunting efforts as well...


### Day 0: February 5, 2017

**Job Hunting**
I've been kind of passively looking for work before and during my internship, the totals of those efforts have been...
* 31 Jobs applied for (most "inApply" on LinkedIn)
* 4 phone interviews
* 1 in-person interiew
* 2 rejection letters
* 1 job passed on

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing this tag a lot lately and a couple friends are doing it, I think. I'm not sure I want to make a commitment to code everyday. I mean, I do. But I'm not sure what counts. If I write code for 8 hours at work, do I still need to do another hour each night after work? (That's kind of the way I'm interpreting it...so it feels like logging work-related code might be cheating. But sometimes I work on it at home too... and then there really isn't any time!)
