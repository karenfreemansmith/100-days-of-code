**Job Hunting**
Posted updates on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter that I'm done with my internship and looking for work. Also recently updated and turned "on" profiles on Monster and Dice.com. Plus, I'm doing this code challenge to keep my skills sharp (and add a few new ones).

**Thoughts:** 
I finished my internship yesterday and so feel like this is a good time to start on something new (and code-intensive). I'm looking for a real job and hope that I will find one before the end of this 100 days - which by the nature of new jobs may keep me from finishing - but in a good way. In the meantime I have been continuing through the JavaScript30 program and am on day 25 today. I'm planning to finish the series, take the flexbox and redux series that are offered for free, and pay my bills to see if I can afford the paid courses. I've got lots of school projects that could be improved on, and the curriculum for the classes I didn't take in PHP and C# seem like good candidates for things to do. We also have "Demo Day" coming up in a couple weeks and there are projects to polish up for that in the short term. 100 days seems like a long time. I think I should track my job hunting efforts as well...


### Day 0: February 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not sure it's relevant... I did day 19 of JavaScript30 for a few hours, but I'm starting tomorrow...or next weekend, or maybe in 3 weeks when my internship is over...

* [???](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith/)

**Job Hunting**
I've been kind of passively looking for work before and during my internship, the totals of those efforts have been...
* 31 Jobs applied for (most "inApply" on LinkedIn)
* 4 phone interviews
* 1 in-person interiew
* 2 rejection letters
* 1 job passed on

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing this tag a lot lately and a couple friends are doing it, I think. I'm not sure I want to make a commitment to code everyday. I mean, I do. But I'm not sure what counts. If I write code for 8 hours at work, do I still need to do another hour each night after work? (That's kind of the way I'm interpreting it...so it feels like logging work-related code might be cheating. But sometimes I work on it at home too... and then there really isn't any time!)
